# Deep-Learning-for-Visual-Analysis-and-Monitoring

This project highlights my proficiency in applying deep learning for various visual recognition and monitoring tasks.
Utilizing libraries like MediaPipe and OpenCV, I developed solutions for:
● 3D Object Detection: Identifying and locating objects within 3D space using images or videos.
● Facial and Hand Landmark Detection: Accurately pinpointing key facial features and hand keypoints in real-time
video streams or images.
